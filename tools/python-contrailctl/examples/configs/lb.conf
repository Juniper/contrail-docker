# hosts_entries: (OPTIONAL) a dict in form of {name1: 1.1.1.1, name2: 1.1.1.2}
# In multi-controller systems, all hosts in the cluster should be reachable
# using its own hostname which is requirement for rabbitmq, so for that /etc/hosts
# entries are required, unless there is an external dns infrastructure to support it
# Alternatively one can write /etc/hosts entries on the host before starting
# the container, in which case container will take those entries.
