# In multi-controller systems, all hosts in the cluster should be reachable
# using its own hostname which is requirement for rabbitmq, so for that /etc/hosts

# Alternatively one can write /etc/hosts entries on the host before starting

# controller_ip - An IP address using which one can connect to all public
