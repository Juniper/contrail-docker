# controller_ip - An IP address using which one can connect to all public

# [KEYSTONE] - Section to get informtion about the keystone to be used by contrail,
# Required only when orchestration is 'openstack' and keystone is managed/provisioned

[AGENT]
# physical interface used by vhost interface

# OPTIONAL: ctrl_data_network - control data network in cidr format e.g 192.168.0.0/24

# OPTIONAL: ctrl_data_ip - the ip address of the node that is in ctrl_data_network
# you may configure ether one of ctrl_data_ip or ctrl_data_network

# OPTIONAL: vrouter_agent_ip - vrouter agent ip address, only required while setting up
# nested mode kubernetes in which case vrouter_agent_ip will be a linklocal service ip.
